Yesterday there was an intresting (and sometimes, funny) report published on [Stackoverflow][stackoverflow-vim-report].
It analyses the amount of people struggling to exit Vim (and googling for an answer/a hint) and shows the numbers per country and "kind of programmers".
Probably because Ukraine is on the first place in "asking Stackoverflow on how to exit vim", it has arisen a big discussion in the [Ukrainian devlopers community][dou-on-vim]. The community agreed that comparision among countries is not a kind of relevant metric: "the fact that there are no googlers from Japan on 'how to fix [Lada][lada-wiki]' doesn't mean they all know the answer, but they just neither use Google or Lada" ;)

At the same time, by reading that report people get to know several methods to EXIT VIM.

The ultimate cheatsheet on the topic was eventually found on reddit:

There was another investigation on this topic some time ago:
