# Conditional structures


```ruby
if x > 2
  puts "x is greater than 2"
elsif x <= 2 and x!=0
  puts "x is 1"
else
  puts "I can't guess the number"
end
```


## if modifier

```ruby
code if condition
```

```ruby
$debug = true
...
puts "debug message" if $debug
```


## unless

```ruby
unless x>2
   puts "x is less than 2"
 else
   puts "x is greater than 2"
end
```

Avoid using `else` in `unless` statements
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


## case Statement

```ruby
case age
when 0 .. 2
   puts "baby"
when 3 .. 6
   puts "little child"
when 7 .. 12
   puts "child"
when 13 .. 18
   puts "youth"
else
   puts "adult"
end

# => shows `child` if age = 8
```


# while Statement

```ruby
i, n = 0, 5

while i < n  do
   puts i*i
   i +=1
end
# => 0 1 4 9 16
```


```ruby
i, n = 0, 5
begin
   puts i*i
   i +=1
end while i < n
# => 0 1 4 9 16
```


## until Statement

```ruby
until i > n  do
   puts i*i
   i +=1;
end
# => 0 1 4 9 16 25
```

## for Statement

```ruby
for i in 0..5
   puts i
end
```


## break and next Statements

```ruby
for i in 0..5
   if i > 2 then
      break
   end
   puts "Value of i is #{i}"
end
# => Value of i is 0
# => Value of i is 1
# => Value of i is 2
```

```ruby
for i in 0..5
   if i < 2 then
      next
   end
   puts "Value of i is #{i}"
end
# => Value of i is 2
# => Value of i is 3
# => Value of i is 4
# => Value of i is 5
```
